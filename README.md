VirtualDanceFloor
=================

This project is a deliverable for Aalto University course Experimental User Interfaces.

VirtualDanceFloor is, as the name suggests, a party in a virtual 3D dance floor setting. 
By utilizing the Microsoft Kinect sensor, users can control their avatars in the 
virtual world by moving their body in the real world. 

There are some gestures to interact with the scene, like for starting up the party mode one 
has to make a "Saturday Night Fever" pose, and standing still with hands on sides will stop the party.
